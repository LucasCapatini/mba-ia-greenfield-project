# task-dx-volumes-e-jest — Context

## Scope

Volume nomeado para node_modules nos dois compose (nestjs-project/compose.yaml e next-frontend/compose.yaml, no frontend também para .next), sobrepondo o bind mount 9p: medido em 2026-10-18, require("jsdom") leva ~100 s pelo bind mount contra o timeout fixo de 60 s do worker do Vitest 4, e a compilação fria do Nest leva ~6 min. Adicionar --forceExit aos scripts test e test:e2e do nestjs-project/package.json (Jest não encerra por handles abertos, pré-existente). Atualizar nestjs-project/CLAUDE.md, next-frontend/CLAUDE.md e o README raiz: npm install obrigatório após o primeiro up e após mudar package.json; node_modules do host deixa de refletir o do container; exceção do Playwright, que roda no host e precisa de node_modules do host com @playwright/test.

## Inherited Decisions Detail

_(inherited TDs — from phases-reader (latest completed phase: 02, both slices) plus the correlator-confirmed doc `saneamento-fase-02-e-infra`; dedupe applied)_

### phase-02-auth/TD-01

**Recommendation:** Argon2id — For a greenfield project in 2026, Argon2id is the OWASP-recommended choice. The native build dependency is a one-time Docker setup cost. The project has no legacy constraints favoring bcrypt. OWASP minimum: 19MiB memory, 2 iterations.
**Libraries:** `argon2@^0.41.x`

### phase-02-auth/TD-02

**Recommendation:** Option A (@nestjs/passport) — The project plan includes only email/password auth for now, but the plugin architecture costs little and future phases may add social login. Aligns with official NestJS docs, making onboarding and maintenance easier.
**Note:** Decision deliberately diverged from the Recommendation during implementation — custom guards were preferred over `@nestjs/passport` to keep the dependency surface smaller; social login is not on the near-term roadmap, so the plugin-architecture benefit did not justify the extra abstraction layer.
**Libraries:** `@nestjs/jwt@^11.0.0`

### phase-02-auth/TD-03

**Recommendation:** Option A (Refresh Token Rotation) — Provides the strongest security model with automatic theft detection. The DB write overhead is acceptable for a video platform (auth refresh is infrequent vs. video operations). PostgreSQL is already in the stack, so no new infrastructure needed. Race conditions can be mitigated with a short grace period for the old token.
**Libraries:** —

### phase-02-auth/TD-04

**Recommendation:** Option B (Random Opaque Tokens in DB) — Revocability is important: when a user requests a new password reset, previous tokens should be invalidated. The DB table is trivial to implement, and the tokens table can also serve future needs (e.g., API keys). Keeps email tokens decoupled from the JWT auth system.
**Libraries:** —

### phase-02-auth/TD-05

**Recommendation:** Option A (@nestjs-modules/mailer) — Best NestJS integration with minimal boilerplate. Supports SMTP (matching the architecture diagram), works with MailHog/Mailpit for local development without external dependencies, and scales to any SMTP provider in production. Template engine support (Handlebars) simplifies email formatting. No vendor lock-in.
**Libraries:** `@nestjs-modules/mailer@^2.x`, `handlebars@^4.x`

### phase-02-auth/TD-06

**Recommendation:** Option A (class-validator + class-transformer) — This is a backend-only project (no shared schemas with frontend), so Zod's single-source-of-truth advantage is less impactful. class-validator is the documented NestJS approach, and the project already uses decorators extensively (TypeORM entities, NestJS DI). Fewer integration surprises with NestJS 11.
**Libraries:** `class-validator@^0.14.x`, `class-transformer@^0.5.x`

### phase-02-auth/TD-07

**Recommendation:** Option A (Custom Domain Exception Filter) — Provides machine-readable error codes that the Next.js frontend can switch on, without the overhead of RFC 9457's URI-based type system. The project is single-consumer (first-party frontend), so a simple `{ statusCode, error, message }` format with domain codes balances clarity and simplicity. The custom filter cost is low — two small files.
**Libraries:** —

### phase-02-auth/TD-08

**Recommendation:** Option A (@nestjs/throttler) — Native NestJS integration is decisive: the guard system allows scoping rate limiting to `AuthModule` only via module-level `APP_GUARD`, with `@SkipThrottle()` for exemptions. The project is single-instance with no distributed requirements, so in-memory storage is sufficient. Using express-rate-limit would bypass NestJS's DI and guard lifecycle for no clear benefit.
**Libraries:** `@nestjs/throttler@^6.x`

### phase-02-auth/TD-09

**Recommendation:** Option B (Opaque) — Since DB lookup is mandatory (TD-03), JWT signature adds no security value. Opaque tokens are shorter, leak no data, and are simpler to generate.
**Note:** Decision deliberately diverged from the Recommendation — JWT was kept to reuse the access-token signing/verification infrastructure (`@nestjs/jwt`), trading token size and base64-readability for a single token format across the codebase.
**Libraries:** `@nestjs/jwt@^11.0.0`

### phase-02-auth/TD-10

**Recommendation:** Option A — The platform is a video sharing service with URL-based channel handles. A strict `[a-z0-9_]` allowlist is the simplest and most portable choice: no extra dependencies, no edge cases around hyphen positioning, and the `user_<random>` fallback provides a valid handle even for extreme email prefixes. Hyphens can always be added in a future iteration if user feedback justifies it.
**Libraries:** —

### phase-02-auth-frontend/TD-01

**Recommendation:** Three reasons. (1) **Architectural fit.** The strict-BFF model in `next-frontend-config-base/TD-03` already nominates the Route Handler as the only NestJS caller; cookie-based sessions are the natural match, and Auth.js's framework adds layers between the BFF and the cookie that buy nothing because the backend is the auth authority — Auth.js's value (DB adapters, OAuth providers, magic-link, `getServerSession` helpers) is mostly unused in this configuration. (2) **Smaller blast radius.** A ~50-LOC session helper is grep-friendly, debuggable, and test-friendly via the existing MSW+BFF integration test pattern; a misconfigured Auth.js callback is a longer fault-isolation loop. (3) **Compatibility with Next.js 16 / React 19.** Built-in `next/headers` `cookies()` is the canonical primitive both runtimes already use; Auth.js v5 versions track Next.js majors with a lag, adding compatibility risk that Option A does not have. Option C is rejected as unsafe (`localStorage` for refresh tokens) and architecturally regressive (loses RSC personalization).
**Libraries:** —

### phase-02-auth-frontend/TD-02

**Recommendation:** Three reasons. (1) **Defense in depth on the cookie content** — `httpOnly` blocks JS, encryption blocks accidental log/proxy inspection; the marginal cost is one ~3KB dep. (2) **Single cookie to manage** simplifies logout (one `session.destroy()` call) and avoids the orphan-cookie failure mode of Option A. (3) **Room to carry minimal user metadata** (`userId`, `email`, `channelSlug`) lets `app/layout.tsx` RSC render the authenticated chrome (avatar, channel name) without a per-render `/auth/me` round-trip — Phase 04+ gains compound here. Option A is a viable downgrade if the team rejects `iron-session` for any reason; the migration A→B (or B→A) is a one-Route-Handler refactor with no test changes downstream because the BFF interface is unchanged. Option C is rejected: it solves a problem (server-side revocation) the project does not have at the cost of infrastructure the project does not own.
**Libraries:** iron-session

### phase-02-auth-frontend/TD-03

**Recommendation:** The single-flight detail is non-trivial and goes in the helper from day one — tested by MSW with a "two concurrent intercepted upstream calls; one refresh expected" assertion. Option B's client-driven pattern is rejected because it doesn't replace Option A (RSC still needs server-side refresh) — adopting B means doing both. Option C's pre-emptive timer is rejected because the failure modes (multiple tabs, sleep/wake) outweigh the latency saving and force a `"use client"` shell near the root.
**Libraries:** —

### phase-02-auth-frontend/TD-04

**Recommendation:** Three reasons. (1) **Decoupled from TD-05** — works with Route Handlers OR Server Actions; the form code does not change if TD-05 is revisited later. (2) **Aligned with shadcn's canonical form primitive** — the project already commits to `radix-nova` shadcn (`components.json`); `npx shadcn@latest add form` produces react-hook-form wrappers; choosing react-hook-form means using the supported primitive instead of hand-rolling around it. (3) **Zod-first developer ergonomics match the rest of the FE foundation** — `next-frontend-config-base/TD-01` chose Zod 4 for env; the same schemas-as-source-of-truth pattern carries to forms with zero new validator paradigm. Option B is rejected for impedance with shadcn's primitive and for over-investing in progressive-enhancement that the strict-BFF model does not require. Option C is rejected for the per-field boilerplate and the loss of client-side feedback on a project that values quick, type-safe form iteration.
**Libraries:** react-hook-form, @hookform/resolvers

### phase-02-auth-frontend/TD-05

**Recommendation:** Three reasons. (1) **Strict-BFF alignment.** `next-frontend-config-base/TD-03` named Route Handlers as the BFF surface; Option A keeps every mutation visible under `app/api/**`. (2) **Test scaffold already exists** — `next-frontend/CLAUDE.md` § Testing and `next-frontend-msw-foundation` were authored for Route-Handlers-as-functions; Option A reuses them with zero invention. (3) **Single mutation surface** — Phase 02 sets the precedent for Phases 03–07; uniformity beats per-mutation idiom-picking when the cost of inconsistency compounds (Option C). Option B has real ergonomic appeal for the simplest forms but fragments the BFF surface and forces test-pattern reinvention; if the team later wants progressive enhancement for specific forms, the migration A→B is per-form and doesn't require touching unrelated routes — A is the safer default and the cheaper baseline.
**Libraries:** —

### phase-02-auth-frontend/TD-06

**Recommendation:** Two reinforcing reasons. (1) **No first-render flicker, no round-trip** — the session is delivered in the same response as the page HTML; the Client Provider hydrates with the correct initial state; users never see "Login" briefly turn into their avatar. (2) **No new BFF endpoint** — the cookie is the source of truth, RSC reads it, the Provider broadcasts it; the BFF surface stays minimal. The `router.refresh()` requirement after mid-session mutations is a small price (one line in the relevant mutation handler) for the structural benefits. Option B is rejected for the double-read-and-flicker; Option C is dominated by Option B and rejected.
**Libraries:** —

### phase-02-auth-frontend/TD-07

**Recommendation:** Three reasons. (1) **First-paint-correct** — the user sees the right outcome on the first paint, no skeleton, no flicker. (2) **Single integration pattern across both flows** — confirmation is RSC-only; reset is RSC + Client form (TD-04, TD-05 patterns reused) — both share the "RSC owns the token, Client Component owns the input" split. (3) **Email-prefetch behavior** is solved at the backend's idempotent-confirmation level (a small note for `/plan-build` to confirm; not a separate TD). Option B's Route-Handler-as-link-target adds redirects for no clean gain. Option C is dominated.
**Libraries:** —

### saneamento-fase-02-e-infra/TD-01

**Recommendation:** resolve o `host.docker.internal` com duas declarações de rede, mantém intactos todos os comandos documentados e a premissa de `openapi-typing/TD-02`, e deixa a consolidação em compose único (Option C) como candidata natural para a entrada da Fase 03, quando o número de serviços justificar a reescrita da documentação.
**Libraries:** —

### saneamento-fase-02-e-infra/TD-02

**Recommendation:** é a única que executa TD-07 como decidido, com custo de uma variável de ambiente e sem alterar contratos já publicados no `openapi.json`.
**Libraries:** —

### saneamento-fase-02-e-infra/TD-03

**Recommendation:** preserva TD-07 e elimina a falha mais provável do fluxo com uma mudança de poucas linhas, sem reduzir segurança porque o token de confirmação não concede sessão.
**Libraries:** —

### saneamento-fase-02-e-infra/TD-04

**Recommendation:** as primitivas e os tokens já cobrem o visual, e a lista de estados fechada aqui é o que `/plan-build` precisa para gerar os SIs sem inventário.
**Libraries:** —
**Revisions:**
- 2026-10-18 — A lista fechada de estados ganha a tela standalone `/resend-confirmation` (`app/(auth)/resend-confirmation/page.tsx`): mesma composição `Card` + `BrandLogo` + `AuthFooter` e reuso do `ResendConfirmationForm` já entregue no SI-8, servindo de destino ao link que `login-form.tsx` exibe em `403 EMAIL_NOT_CONFIRMED`. Entregue como SI-11 (append-mode manual). Rationale: a revisão de alinhamento com a documentação (README/MBA) encontrou o link apontando para uma rota inexistente (404) desde a Fase 02; a Option A permanece — nenhuma fonte visual nova, só mais um estado derivado do padrão de `/forgot-password`.

### saneamento-fase-02-e-infra/TD-05

**Recommendation:** é o único host que sobrevive às fases seguintes e fecha a capability "Logout" da Fase 02 usando exclusivamente mecanismos já decididos (TD-06 do frontend).
**Libraries:** —

### saneamento-fase-02-e-infra/TD-06

**Recommendation:** entrega a dívida documentada sem ampliar o escopo; registrar as Options B e C como tasks futuras (`ci-backend-openapi-export` e `ci-quality-gates`) a planejar antes da Fase 03, quando o número de endpoints crescer.
**Libraries:** —

### saneamento-fase-02-e-infra/TD-07

**Recommendation:** é o mínimo que torna o Git Flow verificável no histórico; a Option B pode ser aplicada manualmente depois do primeiro PR, quando o status check de TD-06 existir.
**Libraries:** —

## Inherited Conventions

_(from phases-reader — latest completed phase: Phase 02, both slices; bullets carried forward from Phase 01 by its slices)_

- Backend config uses `@nestjs/config` with namespaced `registerAs(name, () => ({...}))` factories — one file per domain in `src/config/`. _(from phase 01)_
- Env variables are validated by a Joi schema in `src/config/env.validation.ts`, passed to `ConfigModule.forRoot({ validationSchema, validationOptions: {...} })`. _(from phase 01)_
- Config is injected into modules via `ConfigType<typeof xxxConfig>` and `@Inject(xxxConfig.KEY)`; the same factory is importable as a plain function. _(from phase 01)_
- `data-source.ts` loads `.env` via `import 'dotenv/config'` at the top, then imports `databaseConfig` and calls it as a plain function. _(from phase 01)_
- Database connection parameters (host, port, etc.) are sourced from a single `databaseConfig` factory — never duplicated between `AppModule` and `data-source.ts`. _(from phase 01)_
- `TypeOrmModule.forRootAsync` is used (not `forRoot`), with `imports: [ConfigModule]`, `inject: [databaseConfig.KEY]`, `useFactory` returning options. _(from phase 01)_

## Inherited Deferred Capabilities

_(from phases-reader — informational-only; plan-validate does NOT fire issues based on unaddressed entries)_

| Capability | Status | Origin phase | Rationale |
|-----------|--------|--------------|-----------|
| Telas de cadastro, login, confirmação de conta e recuperação de senha | deferred | phase-02-auth | `next-frontend/` is not initialized in this phase; UI surfaces start in a later phase. |
| "Confirmação de conta via e-mail com link de ativação" | deferred | phase-02-auth-frontend | deferred_to_next_phase — UI landing screen de-scoped 2026-05-14; FE confirmation flow (TD-07) picked up by a future phase. BE side unchanged in `phase-02-auth`. |
| "Logout" | deferred | phase-02-auth-frontend | deferred_to_next_phase — logout button lives inside authenticated chrome (typically Phase 04). Phase 02 still implements POST `/api/auth/logout` (BFF route handler + `session.destroy()`) so the contract is ready when the chrome lands. |
| "Recuperação de senha (destination screen / set-new-password)" | deferred | phase-02-auth-frontend | deferred_to_next_phase — `/forgot-password` ships this phase sending the e-mail; the reset-password destination screen is absent from Figma → link destination remains a 404 until a later phase delivers the screen via `/screen-inventory` extension run. Documented as a known gap. |
| "Telas de cadastro, login, confirmação de conta e recuperação de senha" | deferred | phase-02-auth-frontend | a tela de confirmação da conta não será implementada nesta fase corrente, será adiada — the umbrella bullet's full coverage requires the confirmação and reset-password destination screens; both are deferred per Non-UI rows above. The 3 ship-this-phase telas (signup, login, forgot-password) are inventoried and covered by their own verbs; the umbrella bullet itself is deferred to the phase that lands the missing screens. |

_Source note carried verbatim from `phase-02-auth-frontend/context.md` (informational): "Historical note (2026-10-18): all four rows above were delivered by `task-saneamento-fase-02-e-infra` (2026-10) — `/confirm-email` (SI-8, `app/(auth)/confirm-email/page.tsx`), logout via the session-aware `AppHeader` in `app/(app)/layout.tsx` (SI-10), `/reset-password` (SI-9, `app/(auth)/reset-password/page.tsx`) and `/resend-confirmation` (SI-11), closing the umbrella "Telas…" bullet. See `docs/tasks/task-saneamento-fase-02-e-infra/` and `docs/decisions/technical-decisions-saneamento-fase-02-e-infra.md` (TD-03/TD-04/TD-05). The table is kept as written for the audit trail."_
